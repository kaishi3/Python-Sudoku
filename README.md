# Python-Sudoku

This is a sudoku generator coded in Python. It generated boards of different difficulties by allowing the user to choose how many boxes they would like to have left as clues (with the lowest number being 17, as that is the minimum required number of filled squares to result in a unique board solution).

Credits to @kying18 (https://github.com/kying18/sudoku) for inspiring me with the general backtracking algorithm and use of recursion to create the board.
